# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection
## Introduction :-
The rice leaf suffers from several bacterial, viral, or fungal diseases and these diseases reduce rice production significantly. To sustain rice demand for a vast population globally.The rice leaves related diseases often pose threats to the sustainable production of rice affecting many farmers around the world. Early diagnosis and appropriate remedy of the rice leaf infection is crucial in facilitating healthy growth of the rice plants to ensure adequate supply and food security to the rapidly increasing population.
### RICE LEAF DISEASE :-        
#### 1. Leaf Smut :-
Leaf Smut, Caused by the fungus. The Fungus produces slightly raised, angular, black spots on both sides of the leaves. Although rare, it also can produce spots on leaf sheaths. The black spots are about  0.5 to 5.0 millimeters long and 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters wide.

In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25-34 degree Celsius, With relative humidity above 70%.
